Mars is sort of cuboid and has carmel and nougat inside and chocolate 
on the outside.
This is another line in which I explain that I actually prefer Snickers.
I prefer Snickers because they have nuts so are crunchy.
I suppose that other chocolate bars are good too. For example, a Lion 
bar is also crunchy.
